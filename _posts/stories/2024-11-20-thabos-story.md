## A Journey of Transformation

Thabo first joined The Mamelodi Initiative's Summer Jam programme in Grade 10. At the time, he was struggling with mathematics and uncertain about his future prospects.

"I didn't believe I could go to university," Thabo recalls. "But the mentors at Summer Jam showed me that with hard work and the right support, anything is possible."

## Building Confidence and Skills

Over three years, Thabo participated in multiple programmes:

- Summer Jam (Grade 10, 11, 12)
- Saturday Classes for Mathematics
- Youth Leadership Council

The combination of academic support and leadership development proved transformative. His mathematics marks improved from 45% to 78%, and he discovered a passion for problem-solving.

## A Bright Future

In 2024, Thabo received acceptance to the University of Pretoria's School of Engineering. He's now in his first year, studying mechanical engineering.

"The Mamelodi Initiative didn't just help me with my marks," Thabo explains. "They helped me believe in myself and see a future I never thought possible."

Thabo continues to volunteer with our programmes, mentoring younger students and showing them what's achievable with dedication and support.
