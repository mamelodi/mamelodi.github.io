This episode of the Youth Leadership Council (YLC) video series aims to explore
the concept of leadership in the context of our communities. Leadership for the
youth, by youth. This month we look at what leadership is with our very own
Godwin Ndabandaba. We explore Freedom Day and what it means to Ama 2000s
(Generation Z).
