## Our Mission

As of 2013, very few South African students possess the skills necessary to
qualify for university.  50% of students drop out of school before ever taking a
university entrance exam.  Of the students who actually stay around long enough
to take the entrance exam, only 11% score high enough to qualify for
university.  One in three students drop out in their first year of university.

The Mamelodi Initiative is here to help transform that story.  Through providing
resources to enable community engagement and education, the Mamelodi Initiative
strives to empower members of the community so that the community can make the
changes it wants to see.
