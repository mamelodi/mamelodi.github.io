In this episode, the Mamelodi Initiative Youth Leadership Council (YLC) leaders team up with the Girls for Girls (G4G) team to facilitate a gender-based violence (GBV) awareness workshop for grade 8-11 students at Lehlabile Secondary School.

We have an in-depth discussion on the importance of having a workshop of this calibre, the value that it brings to the community of Mamelodi, and breaking down common stereotypes with intentions of creating safe spaces for all members of society.

Lastly, the ALA team members Haneen Elmahdi, Saifeddine Lahmar, Mbaka Wainaina, and Philip Kinoti give their highlights of the workshop and their aspirations for the G4G organisation.
