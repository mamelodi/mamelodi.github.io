The Mamelodi Initiative Food Drive reached 125 families across Mamelodi, feeding over 628 individuals. Besides being able to feed the different families, The Initiative was able to bring hope to families in these very difficult times. It is important that as the world goes through this pandemic, we as people step up in making a difference, reaching out and helping our neighbours. Although this was the first time our organisation did something like this, we know that it will not be the last time.
