## Executive Summary

The Mamelodi Initiative Winter Programme 2011 marked the beginning of a sustained effort to combat holiday learning loss in Mamelodi. Running for three weeks during the June-July school holidays at the University of Pretoria Mamelodi campus, this inaugural programme served an average of 154 youth per day, establishing the model that would guide future winter programmes.

## The Challenge

Nelson Mandela once said, "Education is the most powerful weapon you can use to change the world." Yet dropout rates in Gauteng remain extremely high, with only 40% of individuals age 20 and above having passed Matric. Research shows coloured and black learners are most likely to drop out, making this issue particularly urgent in township communities. Higher dropout rates lead to fewer job opportunities, increased reliance on government subsidies, and higher crime rates.

The Annie E. Casey Foundation and the Center for Summer Learning at Johns Hopkins University have consistently pointed to holiday learning loss as a major contributing factor to school failure. The dropout rate dramatically increases from grades 10 to 12, driven by accumulated knowledge gaps and lack of soft skills needed for secondary school success.

## Programme Purpose

The Winter Programme 2011 aimed to support the Mamelodi school system and community by giving learners the skills necessary to succeed in school, careers, and life. The vision: to see every child in Mamelodi achieve success in secondary school. The programme provided a safe space for students to "learn, grow, believe, and achieve" through:

- **Academic Focus**: Small group instruction covering maths, science, technology, and English
- **Meaningful Relationships**: Two teachers per class of 6-12 learners, providing strong role models
- **Enrichment Activities**: Twelve workshops including soccer, rugby, basketball, netball, and more
- **Daily Motivation**: Teambuilding games, thought-provoking messages, and motivational speakers

## Programme Structure

Running Monday through Friday, 9am–1pm daily, the programme featured:

- **Morning Session**: Thought of the day, teambuilding games, motivational speakers
- **Small Groups**: Academic instruction with emphasis on relationship-building
- **Afternoon Enrichment**: Two workshop sessions per learner
- **Closing Session**: Daily announcements and inter-group competitions

## Impact and Vision

The programme prioritized building meaningful relationships with youth, endowing them with the understanding that they don't have to be another statistic. By providing essential soft skills and stifling holiday learning loss, the Winter Programme 2011 laid the groundwork for preparing Mamelodi learners to succeed at the secondary level and continue to university.
