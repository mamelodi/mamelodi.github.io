## Executive Summary

The Mamelodi Initiative Winter Programme 2012 continued the organization's mission to combat holiday learning loss and equip Mamelodi youth with essential skills for success. Running for three weeks during the June-July school holidays at the University of Pretoria Mamelodi campus, the programme saw significant growth, serving an average of 218 learners per day—up from 154 in 2011.

## The Challenge

With only 40% of individuals age 20 and above in Gauteng having passed Matric, dropout rates remain critically high, particularly affecting coloured and black learners. Research from the Center for Summer Learning at Johns Hopkins University shows that holiday learning loss for low-income youth is at least double that of their non-low-income counterparts. The dropout rate dramatically increases from grades 10 to 12, driven by accumulated knowledge gaps and lack of soft skills needed for secondary school success.

## Programme Purpose

The Winter Programme 2012 provided a safe space for students to "learn, grow, believe, and achieve" through:

- **Small Group Instruction**: Classes of 6-12 learners with two teachers focused on maths and English
- **Morning Motivation**: Powerful speakers addressing issues affecting high school students
- **Enrichment Workshops**: Two sessions per learner focusing on individual accomplishments and teamwork
- **Relationship Building**: Strong role models and meaningful connections to show youth they don't have to be another statistic

## Programme Structure

Running Monday through Friday, 9am–2pm daily, the programme included:

- **Opening Session**: Group games, motivational speakers, announcements, and singing
- **Small Groups**: Academic instruction with emphasis on teacher-learner relationships
- **Afternoon Enrichment**: Workshops balancing individual growth with team collaboration
- **Closing Session**: Daily competitions between small groups and final announcements

## Impact and Vision

The programme's success came not just from the curriculum, but from building meaningful relationships between teachers and learners. By supporting the Mamelodi school system and community, the initiative works toward ensuring every child in Mamelodi achieves success in secondary school and is prepared to continue to university.
