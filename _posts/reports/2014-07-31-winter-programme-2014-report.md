## Executive Summary

The Mamelodi Initiative Winter Programme 2014 addressed the critical challenge of holiday learning loss affecting learners in Mamelodi. With dropout rates in Gauteng reaching alarming levels—only 40% of individuals age 20 and above having passed Matric—the programme provided essential academic and soft skills support during the June-July school holiday.

## The Challenge

Research consistently shows that holiday learning loss for low-income youth is at least double that of their non-low-income counterparts. The dropout rate dramatically increases from grades 10 to 12, with many learners lacking the soft skills needed to succeed in secondary school. This accumulation of knowledge gaps leads to higher failure rates, repetition, and ultimately dropping out.

## Programme Purpose

The Winter Programme created a safe space for students to "learn, grow, dream, and achieve" through:

- **Academic Skills**: Focused instruction to combat holiday learning loss
- **Soft Skills Development**: Essential skills for school, career, and life success
- **Mentorship**: Exposure to strong role models and dedicated volunteers
- **Community Building**: Meaningful relationships that empower youth to succeed

## Impact and Vision

The programme prioritized building meaningful relationships with youth, endowing them with the understanding that they don't have to be another statistic. By supporting the Mamelodi school system and community, the initiative works toward its vision: to see every child in Mamelodi achieve success in secondary school and be prepared to continue to university.
