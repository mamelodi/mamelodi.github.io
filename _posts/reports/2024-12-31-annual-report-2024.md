## Executive Summary

In 2024, The Mamelodi Initiative delivered its core programmes (Road to Finals, Summer Jam, and Winter Jam) to over 950 learners across Grades 8–12, focusing primarily on academically at-risk learners. Despite data system limitations, the organisation maintained consistent programme presence at partner schools and during school holidays.

Significant organisational transitions occurred, including leadership appointments and staffing changes. While these affected operations short-term, they strengthened institutional capacity through clearer role definition and improved financial oversight. Manual monitoring systems revealed critical gaps in data collection and learner tracking, informing improvements for subsequent programme cycles.

The organisation closed the year financially stable with an operating surplus and minimal liabilities. 2024 served as a foundational year of consolidation, positioning MI for more structured and sustainable programme delivery ahead.
