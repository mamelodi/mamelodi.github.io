## Programme Reach

- **Total Registered Learners**: 374 students from 63 different schools
- **Total Check-ins**: 4,660 across three weeks
- **Average Daily Attendance**: 291 learners (Week 1: 270, Week 2: 298, Week 3: 310)
- **Peak Attendance**: 314 learners on July 14
- **Grade 11 Focus**: Approximately 40% of all check-ins (1,862 attendance records)
- **School Concentration**: Top 12 schools represented 71% of total enrolment

## Academic Outcomes

The programme used a structured pre- and post-test approach:
- **Week 1**: Covered CAPS Terms 1–2 (pre-test Monday, post-test Friday)
- **Weeks 2–3**: Covered Term 3 (pre-test Monday Week 2, post-test Tuesday Week 3)
- **Assessment Design**: Grades 8–9 wrote foundations papers; Grades 10–12 split between Mathematics and Mathematical Literacy with grade-specific papers

### Strongest Performance Gains:
- **Grade 10 Mathematics**: Median improved from 43% to 53% (p≈0.00012)
- **Grade 12 Mathematics**: Median improved from 35% to 40% (p≈0.0409; two-sample p≈0.0011)
- **Grade 11**: Showed smaller or mixed shifts in both Mathematics and Mathematical Literacy

## Volunteer Programme

From 42 volunteer survey responses:
- **Returning Volunteers**: 57.1% had participated in previous programmes
- **First-Time Volunteers**: 42.9% were new to The Mamelodi Initiative
- **Training Satisfaction**: 90.5% rated training 4–5 out of 5
- **Preparedness**: Approximately 90.5% felt prepared for their roles

### Areas for Improvement:
- **Timekeeping and Role Clarity**: Better structure needed for volunteer responsibilities
- **Training**: Mid-programme reflection day to be added
- **First Aid**: Formalisation of health and safety protocols

## Catering and Operations

### Lunch Programme (Spar):
- **Total Cost**: R169,923.60 (with 5% discount)
- **Challenges**: Late 10:30 AM collections, limited vegetarian variety, allergy handling concerns
- **Main Issue**: "Panini day" with standard filling (ham, eggs, tomatoes, lettuce, mayonnaise) posed allergy risks

### Additional Food Services:
- **Fruit**: R10,000 from Fruitstop Silverton
- **Breakfast**: Prepared in-house with donations, though consistency varied

### Planned Improvements:
- Firm collection time to ensure timely lunch delivery
- Better labelling for allergens and dietary requirements
- Vegetarian rotation to provide variety
- Formalised catering protocols

## Financial Performance

The programme achieved significant cost savings:
- **Budgeted**: R333,100
- **Actual Spend**: R258,745
- **Savings**: R74,355 (22% under budget)

### Major Variances:
- **Savings**: Catering and stationery categories
- **Modest Overspends**: Transport and marketing

## Next Steps and Future Programmes

### Immediate Improvements:
- Single pre/post assessment with unique learner IDs for better data tracking
- Strengthened first aid protocols and volunteer training
- Formalised catering procedures with clear timelines

### Upcoming Programme Dates:
- **Road to Finals (RTF)**: Resumes August 6, 2025
- **Youth Leadership Council (YLC)**: Resumes August 9, 2025
- **Summer Jam 2026**: Training January 3, Programme January 5–11
- **Winter Jam 2026**: Training June 27, Programme June 29–July 17

## Conclusion

Winter Jam 2025 demonstrated strong learner engagement and meaningful academic gains, particularly in senior-level mathematics. The programme's steady attendance growth and volunteer retention rates underscore the community's trust in The Mamelodi Initiative's mission. With identified operational improvements and refined assessment methodologies, future programmes will continue to build on this foundation of academic support and youth empowerment.
