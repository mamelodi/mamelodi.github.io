## Key Highlights

- **Total Students**: 288 learners (peak attendance on January 9)
- **Volunteer Educators**: 54 volunteers participated in training and instruction
- **Venue Transition**: Successfully transitioned from Tsako Thabo to Vista Campus mid-programme
- **Academic Focus**: Intensive mathematics and English instruction with pre- and post-assessments
- **Schools Represented**: 56 different schools from Mamelodi and surrounding areas

## Academic Performance

Mathematics performance showed significant improvement in senior grades:
- **Grade 11**: Significant improvement (p=0.001, avg increase 13 points)
- **Grade 12**: Significant improvement (p=0.005, avg increase 12 points)
- **Grade 10**: Noticeable improvement, though sample size was small

English results were more complex, with Grade 12 showing significant improvement
of 25.75 points (p=0.014). Apparent declines in other grades (Grade 8, Grade 10)
were not statistically significant (p>0.3), indicating they were likely due to
sampling variability and assessment design factors rather than actual
performance decreases. These findings highlight the need for refined assessment
methodologies in future programmes.

## Programme Challenges and Learning

The programme faced venue uncertainty due to infrastructural delays, resulting
in an emergency transition from Tsako Thabo to Vista Campus on January 6, 2025.
Despite bulk SMS communication efforts, initial attendance was lower than
expected, highlighting the critical importance of early venue confirmation for
future programmes.

Additional challenges included health and safety incidents that underscored the
need for enhanced first-aid training, dietary requirement management with
caterers, and specialized support for learners with special needs.

## Looking Forward

Lessons learned from SJ25 will inform the upcoming Road to Finals (RTF) and
Youth Leadership Council (YLC) pilot programmes launching in February 2025. Key
improvements include enhanced emergency protocols, clearer catering agreements,
volunteer first-aid certification, and potential development of tailored
programmes for primary school learners.
