## Key Highlights

- **New Venue**: First-time hosting at Tsako Thabo Secondary School with strong community support
- **Collaborative Partnership**: Worked alongside IkamvaYouth Mamelodi for enhanced programme delivery
- **Volunteer Engagement**: Strong volunteer participation forming the backbone of the programme
- **Academic Focus**: Pre- and post-testing across core subjects to measure learner progress
- **Community Environment**: Supportive and secure learning environment fostered by school and community

## Academic and Attendance

Academic progress varied across subjects, with pre-test and post-test results indicating substantial learner engagement. Attendance fluctuated throughout the programme, with notable increases toward the end, particularly among Road to Finals (RTF) matric students preparing for final examinations.

## Food and Catering

The programme was catered by Spar and Pick & Pay, with Fruit Stop Silverton delivering fresh fruit weekly. The menu included burgers, chips, hot dogs, sandwiches, assorted rolls, and fruits. While the variety received positive feedback, Spar experienced delivery timing challenges. Pick & Pay consistently delivered on time and successfully accommodated learners with allergies, establishing them as the preferred caterer for future events.

## Looking Forward

Lessons learned from Winter Jam 2024, particularly regarding venue coordination and catering partnerships, informed the planning for Summer Jam 2025. The successful collaboration with Tsako Thabo and community engagement strategies will continue to shape future programmes.
