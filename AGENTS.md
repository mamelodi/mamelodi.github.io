# AI Agent Instructions
- Project is a GitHub Pages Jekyll site for The Mamelodi Initiative using the Minimal Mistakes remote theme; core settings live in [_config.yml](_config.yml), which also references the exact version of the remote theme being used (e.g., 4.27.3)
- Never edit generated output in [_site](_site); change sources in [_pages](_pages), [_posts](_posts), [_data](_data), and [assets](assets).
- Home uses layout `splash` with hero overlay in [_pages/home.md](_pages/home.md); the `feature_row` include is currently commented out.
- Static pages (About, Programmes, Volunteer, Donate) use layout `single` with `author_profile: true`, optional `toc: true`; see [_pages/about.md](_pages/about.md) and [_pages/programmes.md](_pages/programmes.md).
- News index uses layout `home` with `entries_layout: list` in [_pages/news.md](_pages/news.md).  The layout has been modified via [_includes/archive-single.html](_includes/archive-single.html) to add teaser / thumbnail images to the left of each post link.
- Category landing pages live in [_pages/news-media.md](_pages/news-media.md), [_pages/news-stories.md](_pages/news-stories.md), and [_pages/news-reports.md](_pages/news-reports.md); keep `taxonomy` values (`media`, `stories`, `reports`) aligned with post `categories`.
- Posts are organized in subdirectories by category: [_posts/media](_posts/media), [_posts/stories](_posts/stories), and [_posts/reports](_posts/reports). All posts follow `YYYY-MM-DD-title.md` naming; include `categories` (matching taxonomy), optional `tags`, `excerpt`, and `header.teaser` for card thumbnails. Examples: [2015-05-20-marvin-lukas-segl.md](_posts/stories/2015-05-20-marvin-lukas-segl.md), [2025-02-04-summer-jam-2025-report.md](_posts/reports/2025-02-04-summer-jam-2025-report.md), [2013-07-31-why-education.md](_posts/media/2013-07-31-why-education.md).
- Media embeds use the Minimal Mistakes video include (`{% include video id="..." provider="youtube" %}` or `provider="vimeo"`); see [2013-07-31-why-education.md](_posts/media/2013-07-31-why-education.md) for Vimeo and [2021-02-16-stationary-drive.md](_posts/media/2021-02-16-stationary-drive.md) for YouTube.
- Navigation menu is defined in [_data/navigation.yml](_data/navigation.yml); update this for new top-level links.
- Favicon and manifest tags are injected via [_includes/head/custom.html](_includes/head/custom.html); place icon assets under [assets/favicon](assets/favicon).
- Buttons/styles rely on Minimal Mistakes utility classes, e.g., `{: .btn .btn--primary .btn--large}` as used in [_pages/donate.md](_pages/donate.md).
- Markdown engine is kramdown with Rouge; front matter keys `author_profile`, `toc`, `entries_layout`, `taxonomy`, and `header` drive theme behavior.
- Permalinks are set explicitly per page; keep trailing slashes (e.g., `/news/`, `/donate/`) to match navigation and avoid redirects.
- Plugins are pinned through the `github-pages` gem and `jekyll-include-cache`; pagination via `jekyll-paginate` is enabled.
- Local dev: run `bundle install` once, then `bundle exec jekyll serve --livereload`; restart the server after editing [_config.yml](_config.yml).
- Production check: `JEKYLL_ENV=production bundle exec jekyll build` mirrors GitHub Pages; output lands in [_site](_site).
- Deployment: pushing to the default branch triggers GitHub Pages build; `baseurl` is empty so links are absolute from root.
- Assets: store images in [assets/images](assets/images) and reference with absolute `/assets/...` paths; prefer `header.teaser` for post list thumbnails.
- Site metadata (title, subtitle, author links, social placeholders) is configured in [_config.yml](_config.yml); keep `locale` and `url` consistent.
- Prefer theme overrides via local `_includes`, `_layouts`, or `_sass` rather than modifying generated or remote theme files.
- When adding new section pages, mirror existing front matter patterns to maintain layout consistency and navigation expectations.
