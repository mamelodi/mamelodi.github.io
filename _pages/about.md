## Our Mission

The Mamelodi Initiative is a not-for-profit organization focused on improving
the lives of residents in Mamelodi, South Africa. Through providing resources to
enable community engagement and education, the Mamelodi Initiative strives to
empower members of the community so that the community can make the changes it
wants to see.

## Why Education

Nelson Mandela once said, "Education is the most powerful weapon you can use to
change the world."

Unfortunately, less than 50% of adults in Gauteng passed Matric and research
shows non-white South Africans are the most likely to drop out, making this
issue even more urgent in township communities. Increased drop-out rates lead to
higher unemployment, higher crime rates, and more reliance on the government.
Part of the reason for drop-outs is an accumulation of a knowledge gap. Research
shows the holiday learning loss for low-income or disadvantaged youth is at
least double that of their higher-income counterparts who traditionally have
greater access to holiday programming.

Mamelodi is home to between 450,000 and 1.5 million people. Yet many youths,
particularly young women, are not given the opportunity to access educational
opportunities that can literally transform the world within which they operate.
Mamelodi is challenged with high drop out rates, low matric pass rates, and
extremely low university attendance rates. We have chosen to implement our
programming here because we want to equip young people in Mamelodi with that
"most powerful weapon" so that they can change their world.

## Our History

The Mamelodi Initiative was started in 2007 as a collaborative effort comprised
of individuals who care about the future of the Mamelodi Township and its youth.
In 2010, the initiative evolved to focus specifically on education, developing a
structured year-round programming model. Today, thousands of youth have
benefited from programming provided through the initiative. The coalition offers
a variety of engaging opportunities, from computer literacy to sports to holiday
camps, all aimed at improving and empowering Mamelodi teens.

## Our Values

  change.
- We believe that all children deserve safe places to **grow** physically,
