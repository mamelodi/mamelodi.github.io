## Saturday Classes

The Mamelodi Initiative's Saturday classes address the challenges of overpopulated classrooms and high student-to-teacher ratios in Mamelodi schools. These supplementary classes provide focused attention on core subjects, with particular emphasis on mathematics and English.

Classes are held every Saturday at our partner schools, combining academic rigor with community engagement to help students reach their full potential.
