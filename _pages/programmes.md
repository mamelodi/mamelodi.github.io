## Road to Finals

The Mamelodi Initiative's Road to Finals (RTF) programme consists of extra classes
that address the challenges of overpopulated classrooms and high
student-to-teacher ratios in Mamelodi schools. These classes provide focused
attention on core subjects, with particular emphasis on mathematics and English.
Additional subjects include life sciences, physical sciences, accounting, and
others.

Classes are held weekly after school and on Saturdays at our partner schools
throughout school terms (February-June and July-December), combining academic
rigor with community engagement to help students reach their full potential.

**Serves:** Grades 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12

## Youth Leadership Council

The Youth Leadership Council (YLC) empowers young leaders in Mamelodi to make
positive changes in their community. Meeting monthly throughout the year,
students develop leadership skills, civic engagement, and a voice in shaping the
future of their township.
